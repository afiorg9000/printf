.SH NAME

_printf - Formatted Output Conversion.

.SH SYNOPSIS

#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

The _printf() function prints output from a format string that specifies how a subsequent argument is converted for output.

.B Return value

Upon successful return, return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

.B format of the format string

The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its
initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or
more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged
to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of wich results
in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

.B The converion specifier

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifier and their meanings are:

.B d, i

The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.B c

The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

.B s

Characters from the array are written up to (but no including)
a terminating null byte ('\0').

.B %

A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

.SH EXAMPLE

#include "main.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */

int main (void)

{
	int len;

	len = _printf("Percent:[%%]\n");
	return(0);
}
